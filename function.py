*   Defining math overloads requires that the mathematical Functions are at
    hand.  But those are derivatives of ``Function``.  So we would have to
    define the Functions for mathematical overloads in the same scope as the
    Function base class.

*   Defining the ``Function`` class first, it is possible to define 
    mathematical Functions in ``moviemaker2.math``, when defining the 
    ``MathFunction`` class, which has mathematical overloads using those
    mathematical Functions.

*   Tests whether an object is a function or not require only testing if the
    object is an instance of ``Function``.
